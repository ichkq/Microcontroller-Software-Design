# Joystick-Controlled LED Matrix
#This project demonstrates a microcontroller-based system that uses a joystick to control an LED matrix. The system is implemented using STM32 HAL and peripherals such as SPI and GPIO to communicate with the MAX7219 LED driver and read joystick input. A UART interface is utilized for debugging and status reporting.
